# Data Manipulation and Transformation with Pandas and NumPy

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for practicing data manipulation and transformation techniques using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, two of the most popular libraries in Data Science.

The aim of this repository is to demonstrate and apply the skills acquired during a course focused on handling large numerical datasets and tables. The course emphasized creating and using **DataFrames** and **Arrays** to analyze data efficiently.

## Course Description
The course, titled **"Manipulate and Transform Large Amounts of Numerical Data and Tables with Pandas and NumPy"**, covered the following key concepts:
- Working with **Pandas DataFrames** to organize, manipulate, and analyze structured data.
- Utilizing **NumPy Arrays** for fast numerical computations on large datasets.
- Cleaning and transforming data to prepare it for analysis.
- Performing aggregations, statistical operations, and data wrangling techniques.

By the end of the course, I gained the ability to manipulate and transform complex datasets, perform essential data analysis tasks, and prepare data for more advanced explorations and modeling.

## Key Features of This Repository
- **DataFrame Manipulation**: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and transforming data using Pandas DataFrames.
- **Numerical Operations with NumPy**: Examples of numerical operations performed using NumPy arrays.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Code samples demonstrating how to group and aggregate data for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Examples of how to handle missing data, duplicates, and perform other cleaning tasks.
  

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **Pandas**: You can install it via pip with `pip install pandas`.
- **NumPy**: Install via pip with `pip install numpy`.
